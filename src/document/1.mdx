# 1.

In this individual part, we will develop and argue several approaches in segmentation and taste variation, using the dataset that we used in homework 1.

---

We first present the "best" models we have determined in the previous homework and then will try to improve the models by segmentation method. The models below are the best models (BF: female, BM: male) in homework 1. In the assignment statement, we have been supposed to improve the models with some feedback, but there was no specific comment to improvement the performance of the best models. Therefore, we will use them as the basis of the discussion in this document.

We have removed a participant from the model creation if they have more than an invalid value in the variables (e.g., negative commute time) shown in each model. Note that, in this part we used `apollo` package in R whereas in the previous document we coded the logit model by ourselves. Therefore, some of the estimates have varied from what appeared in the homework 1 document. We will skip the interpretation of the estimates and significance in this part as it is the same model already explained in the past.

# 2.

Once we identify the base models, first we use each model to estimate the population of **opposite** gender or the **entire** population. It means, we use the BF model to estimate whether male workers would telecommute or not, and whether all the workers would telecommute or not. The following tables displays the details of the BF model when the sample has been changed.
