# 1.

In this individual part, we will develop and argue several approaches in segmentation and taste variation, using the dataset that we used in homework 1.

---

We first present the "best" models we have determined in the previous homework and then will try to improve the models by segmentation method. The models below are the best models (FSE: female, TMA: male) in homework 1.

We have removed a participant from the model creation if they have more than an invalid value in the variables (e.g., negative commute time) shown in each model. Note that, in this part we used `apollo` package in R whereas in the previous document we coded the logit model by ourselves. Therefore, some of the estimates have varied from what appeared in the homework 1 document. Typically, the variable "jobhome" (some job can be done from home) no longer be significant in the model in both cases. It is an odd behavior but now we should remove the variable from the base models as it seems causing a singularity (perfect estimation) problem. Therefore, the base models (BF: female, BM: male) would have the following structure.
