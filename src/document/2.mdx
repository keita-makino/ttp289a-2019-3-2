This section will examine the validity of the BS model that we have developed in the previous section, using Hausman-McFadden (H-M) Test [1].

This test will evaluate the difference between the estimates and variance-covariance matrix of restricted/unrestricted (R/U) model, and compute the test statistic

$$
\mathcal{H} = \beta \times \boldsymbol{V} \times \beta'
$$

where $\beta$ and $\boldsymbol{V}$ respectively represents for the estimates of R model subtracted by that of U model, and variance-covariance matrix of R model subtracted by that of U model. Note that, because the number of variables in R and U model is different, we cannot compute this statistic without selecting variable. According to `hmftest` function in `mlogit` package, it seems that including ASCs which are available in both R and U model is correct. Therefore, the $\beta$ here has 4 elements in its vector.

Since H-M test needs a variable being truncated in the restricted model, we develop three restricted models, which respectively truncates rapid transit, train, or auto mode.

The following tables displays the details of the three restricted models, namely RE (without rapid-transit), RT (without train) and RA (without auto) model.

**Table 5.3. RA Model (N=69)**

| Variable               | Estimate                   | Std. Error      | t-Sta.               |
| ---------------------- | -------------------------- | --------------- | -------------------- |
| asc_el                 | 1.364                      | 0.904           | -1.510 \*            |
| asc_train              | (base)                     | -               | -                    |
| General Service        | 1.774                      | 0.700           | 2.533 \*\*           |
| Lack of Travel Stress  | 1.232                      | 0.539           | 2.288 \*\*           |
| Travel Time            | -0.116                     | 0.040           | -2.884 \*\*          |
| $\mathcal{L}$: -15.461 | $\mathcal{L}(EL)$: -47.827 | $\rho^2$: 0.677 | Adj. $\rho^2$: 0.593 |

Then, the statistics can be evaluated as:

$$
\begin{cases}
  \mathcal{H}(RE) = 3.039 \\
  \mathcal{H}(RT) = 12.942 \\
  \mathcal{H}(RA)\text{*} = 4.374
\end{cases}
$$

(\*: The unrestricted model for RA model has the same structure to BS model but its base is train mode.)

Then, considering that the statistics will follow $\chi(d.f.=4)$ under $H_0: \text{There is no violation of IIA in the unrestricted model}$, the p-values of the test are:

$$
\begin{cases}
  p(RE) = 1 - \displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{3.039} \chi^2(x,4) dx = 0.551 \\
  p(RT) = 1 - \displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{12.942} \chi^2(x,4) dx = 0.012 \\
  p(RA) = 1 - \displaystyle\int_{-\infty}^{4.374} \chi^2(x,4) dx = 0.358
\end{cases}
$$

Given this result, we can reject the null hypothesis and conclude that the IIA is violated in the unrestricted model (i.e., BS model).
