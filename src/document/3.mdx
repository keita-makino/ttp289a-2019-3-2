In the last section, we have confirmed that the BS model has violated the IIA assumption. Given such result, in this section, we will make three new nested logit models.

In the nested logit model, there is a "group" of alternatives in the root level of multinomial logit model. For example, we assume that each participant will choose automobile or public transit. Then, in the nested layer, they will choose either rapid transit or train to make the final decision.

Similar in the way selecting the variable to truncate in the last IIA testing section, here we have three options of an alternative to be included in the root layer (i.e., rapid-transit, train or auto. The other two which are not selected will become the "group" and be in the nested layer).

The first model we can create has rapid-transit in the root layer, and has train and automobile in the nested layer.

We can justify this structure with an assumption that whether the mode can handle long-distance travel or not is the most importance factor to narrow down the choices for the individual. With this criteria, rapid-transit, which usually serves only within city central, will be clearly distinguished from the others.

The next structure is to isolate train from the other two. This structure assumes that people most evaluate the factor whether there is a frequent service (rapid-transit) or general availability (automobile).

The last structure separates automobile from the rapid transit and train. Under this model, people would first choose if they like to use public transit or private mode.

We name the nested models with these structure respectively NE, NT, and NA model. The following tables shows the details of the nested models.
