In the end, in this section we will develop several partially-segmented models and determine the best one among them. As discussed in the previous chapter, now the dataset has female-only variables and male-only columns as whose structure has been shown in table 3.2. Using this dataset, partially-segmented model uses a combination of all-gender variables and gender-specific variables.

The first partially-segmented (PS1) model we introduce has the following structure.

**Table 6.1. Structure of PS1 Model**

| Variable                | Type            |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| (Constant)              | Gender-Specific |
| Two-way commute time    | All-Gender      |
| Commute stress          | All-Gender      |
| Lack of manager support | All-Gender      |
| Job unsuitability       | Gender-Specific |
| Age (binary grouping)   | Gender-Specific |
| Office Discipline       | All-Gender      |

In this model, the variables which are identified as a gender-specific variable in FS **and** MS model with more than **95%** confidence level are treated as a gender-specific variable.

**Table 6.2. Structure of PS2 Model**

| Variable                | Type            |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| (Constant)              | Gender-Specific |
| Two-way commute time    | All-Gender      |
| Commute stress          | Gender-Specific |
| Lack of manager support | Gender-Specific |
| Job unsuitability       | Gender-Specific |
| Age (binary grouping)   | Gender-Specific |
| Office Discipline       | All-Gender      |

On the other hand, the second partially-segmented (PS2) model contains more gender-specific variables. If a variable has been determined as gender-specific in FS **or** MS model with **90%** confidence level, we include it as a gender-specific variable in the PS2 model.

Consequently, we obtained the following results from these models.

In summary, both of the models marked a better goodness-of-fit criteria than those of fully-segmented (FS, MS') models. Also, the PS2 model with more segmented variables have achieved the better performance among the partially-segmented models. When we conduct a $\chi^2$ test to these models, using the statistics $L$,

$$
H_0: \text{The performance of PS2 model is not significantly better than that of PS1 model} \Rightarrow L=0 \\
$$

$L$ will follow $\chi^2(d.f.=2)$ under$H_0$. The p-value for this test can be evaluated by

$$
1 - \int_{-\infty}^{L} \chi^2(x,d.f.) dx = 1 - \int_{-\infty}^{-2(-135.270 + 131.431)} \chi^2(x,2) dx = 1 - \int_{-\infty}^{7.678} \chi^2(x,2) dx = 2.152 \times 10^{-2} \text{ **}
$$

Therefore, we can assess that the unrestricted model performs better in the estimation, which points out that segmenting variables which were determined as gender-specific with 90% confidence level will result in a better performance, at least under this dataset and this variable selection.

Looking at each coefficient and pair of them in PS2 model, firstly, the commute time resulted in negative estimate in the final model. This is somehow conterintuitive, because having a longer commute time would affect an employee to have a certain form of telecommuting to reduce the burden of commuting. One possibility is that if an employee lives close to their workplace, they can make a "brief telecommuting" in which they just bring a piece of document or worksheet to their home and make it done in one night. If some people have reported this work style as telecommuting, this sign of the estimate could be acceptable.

The effect of commute stress was determined as positive to both genders. This result is natural and match to a common sense, where people like to telecommute to ameliorate the stress in commuting. Also, its magnitude and significance were higher in female group. This could be interpreted as that female workers have more things to think about in commuting, such as picking-up/dropping-off their children.

Lack of manager support has been determined as a significantly negative factor in choosing telecommuting. This is a matter of course, because everyone needs an approval and support to start and maintain telecommuting. The effect of job unsuitability can be considered in the same way. Some industry, such as biochemistry or agriculture will barely allow workers to have a telecommuting work style. One note in both variables is that, the estimate and significance was lower in male group. It implies that more male workers would be in a position in which they can control their work style as they like. Office discipline was also determined as a negative factor. This is also easy to understand as there will be less chance for an employee to get an approval to work remotely wherever the office has a strict regulation on work.

Age grouping has shown a different significance over the genders. Older female workers would refrain from telecommuting, but age does not seem to matter among male workers. This may be an implication that older female workers tend to have a job where remote work are not generally feasible (Note that the survey was taken in 1977).

Finally, the ASCs, which represents the effect of unobserved variables, have become positive in both genders. This is potentially because we have extracte many variables that give negative effect on selecting telecommuting.
