In the end, in this section we will develop several partially-segmented models and determine the best one among them. As discussed in the previous chapter, now the dataset has female-only variables and male-only columns as whose structure has been shown in table 3.2. Using this dataset, partially-segmented model uses a combination of all-gender variables and gender-specific variables.

The first partially-segmented (PS1) model we introduce has the following structure.

**Table 6.1. Structure of PS1 Model**

| Variable                | Type            |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| (Constant)              | Gender-Specific |
| Two-way commute time    | All-Gender      |
| Commute stress          | All-Gender      |
| Lack of manager support | All-Gender      |
| Job unsuitability       | Gender-Specific |
| Age (binary grouping)   | Gender-Specific |
| Office Discipline       | All-Gender      |

In this model, the variables which are identified as a gender-specific variable in FS **and** MS model with more than **95%** confidence level are treated as a gender-specific variable.

**Table 6.2. Structure of PS2 Model**

| Variable                | Type            |
| ----------------------- | --------------- |
| (Constant)              | Gender-Specific |
| Two-way commute time    | All-Gender      |
| Commute stress          | Gender-Specific |
| Lack of manager support | Gender-Specific |
| Job unsuitability       | Gender-Specific |
| Age (binary grouping)   | Gender-Specific |
| Office Discipline       | All-Gender      |

On the other hand, the second partially-segmented (PS2) model contains more gender-specific variables. If a variable has been determined as gender-specific in FS **or** MS model with **90%** confidence level, we include it as a gender-specific variable in the PS2 model.

Consequently, we obtained the following results from these models.
